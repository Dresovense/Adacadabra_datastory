    "Story" structure:
    - User is a normal person who just got into reddit to explore a specific subreddit of choice [choose one specific theme/subreddit
    we are going to use as an entry point]
    <br>
    - User is surprised at the low quality posts and language of subreddit. Thus they go into an imaginary subreddit to ask
    a question as a "reddit post": "Why is [specific theme/subreddit]" language quality so low?

    <br>
    - Story develops as there is a chain of comments between the op user and different comments, where they explain
    why certain subreddits seem to have a lower quality of language, why certain have higher, ... Basically, our "op user" 
    opens the next "research question", while the different commentators answer the questions with our different plots.
